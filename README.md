Your adventuring party has reached the entrance to the final floor of the dungeon. Weary and tired, you make rest at the top of the stairs, as the sound of a storm rages from below.

As the bard in the party, you must inspire and heal your fellow adventurers with your music in this simple fantasy rhythm game built for Brackeys 2024.2 Game Jam.
